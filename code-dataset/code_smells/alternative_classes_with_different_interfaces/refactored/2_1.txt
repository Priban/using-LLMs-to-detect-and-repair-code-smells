### Step 1: Identify the Code Smell

The code contains several code smells:
1. **Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces**: `SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount` classes have similar functionalities but different method names and properties.
2. **Duplicated Code**: The `API` class has similar methods for handling savings and checking accounts, leading to code duplication.
3. **Long Function**: The `API` class methods are relatively long and repetitive.

### Step 2: Definition of the Code Smell

1. **Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces**: This occurs when two classes perform similar tasks but have different method names and properties, making it harder to use them interchangeably.
2. **Duplicated Code**: This occurs when the same or very similar code exists in multiple places, making the code harder to maintain.
3. **Long Function**: This occurs when a function is too long, making it harder to understand and maintain.

### Step 3: Refactor the Code

To address these code smells, we can:
1. Create a common base class `Account` for `SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount`.
2. Use consistent method names and properties in the derived classes.
3. Refactor the `API` class to reduce code duplication.

Here is the refactored code:

```javascript
class Account {
    constructor(accountNumber, balance) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    deposit(amount) {
        this.balance += amount;
        console.log(`Deposited ${amount} into ${this.constructor.name}. New balance: ${this.balance}`);
    }

    withdraw(amount) {
        if (amount > this.balance) {
            console.log(`Insufficient funds in ${this.constructor.name}.`);
        } else {
            this.balance -= amount;
            console.log(`Withdrew ${amount} from ${this.constructor.name}. New balance: ${this.balance}`);
        }
    }

    getBalance() {
        return this.balance;
    }
}

class SavingsAccount extends Account {
    constructor(accountNumber, balance) {
        super(accountNumber, balance);
    }
}

class CheckingAccount extends Account {
    constructor(accountNumber, balance) {
        super(accountNumber, balance);
    }
}

class API {
    constructor() {
        this.savingsAccounts = [];
        this.checkingAccounts = [];
    }

    createSavingsAccount(accountNumber, balance) {
        const account = new SavingsAccount(accountNumber, balance);
        this.savingsAccounts.push(account);
        return account;
    }

    createCheckingAccount(accountNumber, balance) {
        const account = new CheckingAccount(accountNumber, balance);
        this.checkingAccounts.push(account);
        return account;
    }

    depositToAccount(accounts, accountNumber, amount) {
        const account = accounts.find(acc => acc.accountNumber === accountNumber);
        if (account) {
            account.deposit(amount);
            return account.getBalance();
        } else {
            throw new Error(`${account.constructor.name} not found`);
        }
    }

    withdrawFromAccount(accounts, accountNumber, amount) {
        const account = accounts.find(acc => acc.accountNumber === accountNumber);
        if (account) {
            account.withdraw(amount);
            return account.getBalance();
        } else {
            throw new Error(`${account.constructor.name} not found`);
        }
    }

    getAccountBalance(accounts, accountNumber) {
        const account = accounts.find(acc => acc.accountNumber === accountNumber);
        return account ? account.getBalance() : null;
    }

    depositToSavings(accountNumber, amount) {
        return this.depositToAccount(this.savingsAccounts, accountNumber, amount);
    }

    withdrawFromSavings(accountNumber, amount) {
        return this.withdrawFromAccount(this.savingsAccounts, accountNumber, amount);
    }

    addMoneyToChecking(accountNumber, amount) {
        return this.depositToAccount(this.checkingAccounts, accountNumber, amount);
    }

    withdrawFromChecking(accountNumber, amount) {
        return this.withdrawFromAccount(this.checkingAccounts, accountNumber, amount);
    }

    getSavingsAccountBalance(accountNumber) {
        return this.getAccountBalance(this.savingsAccounts, accountNumber);
    }

    getCheckingAccountFunds(accountNumber) {
        return this.getAccountBalance(this.checkingAccounts, accountNumber);
    }
}

module.exports = { API };
```

### Explanation of Refactoring

1. **Common Base Class**: Created a base class `Account` with common methods `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `getBalance`.
2. **Consistent Method Names**: Both `SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount` now inherit from `Account` and use the same method names.
3. **Reduced Duplication**: The `API` class now has generic methods `depositToAccount`, `withdrawFromAccount`, and `getAccountBalance` to handle both types of accounts, reducing code duplication.

This refactoring improves readability and maintainability while ensuring the external behavior remains the same. The test file remains unchanged and should still pass all tests.
