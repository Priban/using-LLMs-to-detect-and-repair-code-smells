### Step 1: Identify the Code Smell in the Code

The code contains several code smells:
1. **Temporary Field**: The `tempApprovalStatus` field in the `LoanApplication` class is only used temporarily during the `processApplication` method.
2. **Long Function**: The `processApplication` method in the `LoanApplication` class is doing multiple things.
3. **Large Class**: The `LoanApplication` class has multiple responsibilities, including checking credit scores and finalizing approval.
4. **Feature Envy**: The `LoanService` class is managing the `LoanApplication` objects, but it might be better to encapsulate some of this behavior within the `LoanApplication` class itself.

### Step 2: Write Down the Definition of the Code Smell You Identified

1. **Temporary Field**: A field that is set only in certain circumstances and is otherwise empty or null. This can make the code harder to understand and maintain.
2. **Long Function**: A function that does too many things, making it difficult to understand and maintain.
3. **Large Class**: A class that has too many responsibilities, making it difficult to understand and maintain.
4. **Feature Envy**: A method that seems more interested in the data of another class than that of the class it is in.

### Step 3: Refactor the Code

#### Refactored Code

```javascript
class LoanApplication {
  constructor(applicantName, loanAmount, creditScore) {
      this.applicantName = applicantName;
      this.loanAmount = loanAmount;
      this.creditScore = creditScore;
  }

  isCreditScoreSufficient() {
      return this.creditScore >= 700;
  }

  getApprovalStatus() {
      return this.isCreditScoreSufficient() ? 'Approved' : 'Pending Further Review';
  }

  finalizeApproval() {
      const approvalStatus = this.getApprovalStatus();
      if (approvalStatus === 'Approved') {
          console.log(`Loan for ${this.applicantName} has been approved for $${this.loanAmount}.`);
      } else {
          console.log(`Loan for ${this.applicantName} requires further review.`);
      }
  }

  processApplication() {
      this.finalizeApproval();
  }
}

class LoanService {
  constructor() {
      this.loanApplications = [];
  }

  addLoanApplication(applicantName, loanAmount, creditScore) {
      this.loanApplications.push(new LoanApplication(applicantName, loanAmount, creditScore));
  }

  processAllApplications() {
      for (const application of this.loanApplications) {
          application.processApplication();
      }
      return true;
  }
}

class API {
  constructor() {
      this.loanService = new LoanService();
  }

  submitLoanApplication(applicantName, loanAmount, creditScore) {
      this.loanService.addLoanApplication(applicantName, loanAmount, creditScore);
  }

  processLoanApplications() {
      return this.loanService.processAllApplications();
  }
}

module.exports = { API };
```

### Explanation of Refactoring

1. **Temporary Field**: Removed the `tempApprovalStatus` field and replaced it with a method `getApprovalStatus` that computes the approval status on the fly.
2. **Long Function**: Split the `processApplication` method into smaller methods: `isCreditScoreSufficient`, `getApprovalStatus`, and `finalizeApproval`.
3. **Large Class**: The `LoanApplication` class is now more focused on its core responsibilities.
4. **Feature Envy**: The `LoanService` class remains responsible for managing `LoanApplication` objects, but the `LoanApplication` class now encapsulates more of its own behavior.

### Tests

The tests remain the same, ensuring that the refactored code still passes all tests and maintains the same external behavior.

```javascript
const runDescribe = (API, description) => {
  describe(description, () => {
    let api;

    beforeEach(() => {
      api = new API();
    });

    test('should add and process loan application with high credit score successfully', () => {
      const applicantDetails = { applicantName: 'John Doe', loanAmount: 10000, creditScore: 720 };
      api.submitLoanApplication(applicantDetails.applicantName, applicantDetails.loanAmount, applicantDetails.creditScore);

      const result = api.processLoanApplications();

      expect(result).toBe(true);
    });

    test('should add and process loan application with low credit score successfully', () => {
      const applicantDetails = { applicantName: 'Jane Smith', loanAmount: 15000, creditScore: 650 };
      api.submitLoanApplication(applicantDetails.applicantName, applicantDetails.loanAmount, applicantDetails.creditScore);

      const result = api.processLoanApplications();

      expect(result).toBe(true);
    });

    test('should process multiple loan applications', () => {
      const applicant1 = { applicantName: 'John Doe', loanAmount: 10000, creditScore: 720 };
      const applicant2 = { applicantName: 'Jane Smith', loanAmount: 15000, creditScore: 650 };

      api.submitLoanApplication(applicant1.applicantName, applicant1.loanAmount, applicant1.creditScore);
      api.submitLoanApplication(applicant2.applicantName, applicant2.loanAmount, applicant2.creditScore);

      const result = api.processLoanApplications();

      expect(result).toBe(true);
    });
  });
}

module.exports = runDescribe;
```

This refactoring improves the readability and maintainability of the code while ensuring that all tests pass and the external behavior remains the same.
