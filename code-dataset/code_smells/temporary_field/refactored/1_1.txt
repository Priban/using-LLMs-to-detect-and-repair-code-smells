### Step 1: Identify the Code Smell in the Code

The code contains several code smells:
1. **Long Function**: The `updateCartTotal` method is doing more than one thing (calculating the total and applying a discount).
2. **Feature Envy**: The `isBlackFriday` method is more about date logic than shopping cart logic.
3. **Temporary Field**: The `blackFridayDiscount` field is only used temporarily during the calculation of the cart total.
4. **Large Class**: The `ShoppingCart` class has multiple responsibilities (managing items, calculating totals, applying discounts, and handling checkout).

### Step 2: Definition of the Code Smells

1. **Long Function**: A function that does too many things, making it hard to understand and maintain.
2. **Feature Envy**: A method that seems more interested in a class other than the one it actually is in.
3. **Temporary Field**: A field that is only set in certain circumstances and is otherwise empty or null.
4. **Large Class**: A class that has too many responsibilities, making it difficult to understand and maintain.

### Step 3: Refactor the Code

#### Refactoring Steps:

1. **Extract Method**: Split the `updateCartTotal` method into two methods: one for updating the total and one for applying the discount.
2. **Move Method**: Move the `isBlackFriday` method to a utility class.
3. **Remove Temporary Field**: Remove the `blackFridayDiscount` field and calculate the discount directly in the method.
4. **Extract Class**: Create a `Discount` class to handle discount-related logic.

Here is the refactored code:

```javascript
class ShoppingCart {
    constructor() {
        this.items = [];
        this.cartTotal = 0;
    }

    addItem(item) {
        this.items.push(item);
        this.updateCartTotal();
    }

    removeItem(itemId) {
        const itemIndex = this.items.findIndex(item => item.id === itemId);
        if (itemIndex !== -1) {
            this.items.splice(itemIndex, 1);
            this.updateCartTotal();
        }
    }

    updateCartTotal() {
        this.cartTotal = this.items.reduce((total, currentItem) => {
            return total + currentItem.price;
        }, 0);

        this.applyDiscounts();
    }

    applyDiscounts() {
        const discount = Discount.calculateBlackFridayDiscount(this.cartTotal);
        this.cartTotal -= discount;
    }

    checkout() {
        if (this.items.length === 0) {
            console.error('Cannot checkout an empty cart.');
            return false;
        }

        console.log(`Processing payment of $${this.cartTotal.toFixed(2)}`);
        this.items = [];
        this.cartTotal = 0;
        return true;
    }
}

class Discount {
    static calculateBlackFridayDiscount(cartTotal) {
        if (DateUtils.isBlackFriday()) {
            return cartTotal * 0.1;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}

class DateUtils {
    static isBlackFriday() {
        const today = new Date();
        return today.getMonth() === 10 && today.getDate() === 26;
    }
}

class API {
    constructor() {
        this.shoppingCart = new ShoppingCart();
    }

    addItemToCart(item) {
        this.shoppingCart.addItem(item);
    }

    removeItemFromCart(itemId) {
        this.shoppingCart.removeItem(itemId);
    }

    checkoutCart() {
        return this.shoppingCart.checkout();
    }

    getCartTotal() {
        return this.shoppingCart.cartTotal;
    }
}

module.exports = { API };
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Extract Method**: The `updateCartTotal` method now only updates the total, and the discount application is handled by a separate `applyDiscounts` method.
2. **Move Method**: The `isBlackFriday` method is moved to a new `DateUtils` class.
3. **Remove Temporary Field**: The `blackFridayDiscount` field is removed, and the discount is calculated directly in the `applyDiscounts` method.
4. **Extract Class**: A new `Discount` class is created to handle discount-related logic, making the `ShoppingCart` class more focused on its primary responsibility.

The refactored code maintains the same external behavior and should pass all the existing tests.
