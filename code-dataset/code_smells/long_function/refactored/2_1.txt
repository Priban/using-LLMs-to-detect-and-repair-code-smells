### Step 1: Identify the Code Smell in the Code

The code contains several code smells:
1. **Long Function**: The `performTransaction` method in the `Bank` class is quite long and does multiple things.
2. **Duplicated Code**: The code for finding an account by `accountId` is repeated.
3. **Feature Envy**: The `performTransaction` method in the `Bank` class is doing too much work that could be encapsulated within the `Account` class.
4. **Mysterious Name**: The method names like `deduct` and `add` in the `Account` class could be more descriptive.

### Step 2: Write Down the Definition of the Code Smell You Identified

1. **Long Function**: A function that is too long and does too many things, making it hard to understand and maintain.
2. **Duplicated Code**: Code that is repeated in multiple places, making it harder to maintain.
3. **Feature Envy**: A method that seems more interested in the data of another class than its own.
4. **Mysterious Name**: A method or variable name that does not clearly indicate its purpose.

### Step 3: Refactor the Code

#### Refactored Code

```javascript
class Account {
  constructor(accountId, owner, balance) {
      this.accountId = accountId;
      this.owner = owner;
      this.balance = balance;
  }

  withdraw(amount) {
      if (this.balance < amount) {
          throw new Error("Insufficient balance");
      }
      this.balance -= amount;
  }

  deposit(amount) {
      this.balance += amount;
  }

  getDetails() {
      return {
          accountId: this.accountId,
          owner: this.owner,
          balance: this.balance
      };
  }
}

class Bank {
  constructor() {
      this.accounts = [
          new Account(1, "Alice", 1000),
          new Account(2, "Bob", 500)
      ];
      this.transactionLogs = [];
  }

  findAccountById(accountId) {
      return this.accounts.find(acc => acc.accountId === accountId);
  }

  performTransaction(senderId, receiverId, amount) {
      try {
          const senderAccount = this.findAccountById(senderId);
          const receiverAccount = this.findAccountById(receiverId);

          if (!senderAccount) {
              console.log("Sender account not found.");
              return false;
          }

          if (!receiverAccount) {
              console.log("Receiver account not found.");
              return false;
          }

          senderAccount.withdraw(amount);
          receiverAccount.deposit(amount);

          this.logTransaction(senderAccount, receiverAccount, amount);
          console.log(`Transaction complete: ${senderAccount.owner} to ${receiverAccount.owner}, Amount: $${amount}`);
          return true;
      } catch (error) {
          console.log(error.message);
          return false;
      }
  }

  logTransaction(senderAccount, receiverAccount, amount) {
      this.transactionLogs.push({
          from: senderAccount.accountId,
          to: receiverAccount.accountId,
          amount: amount,
          date: new Date()
      });
  }

  getTransactionLogs() {
      return this.transactionLogs;
  }

  getAccountDetails(accountId) {
      const account = this.findAccountById(accountId);
      return account ? account.getDetails() : null;
  }
}

class API {
  constructor() {
      this.bank = new Bank();
  }

  performTransaction(senderId, receiverId, amount) {
      return this.bank.performTransaction(senderId, receiverId, amount);
  }

  getTransactionLogs() {
      return this.bank.getTransactionLogs();
  }

  getAccountDetails(accountId) {
      return this.bank.getAccountDetails(accountId);
  }
}

module.exports = { API };
```

### Explanation of Refactoring

1. **Long Function**: The `performTransaction` method in the `Bank` class has been broken down into smaller methods: `findAccountById` and `logTransaction`.
2. **Duplicated Code**: The code for finding an account by `accountId` has been moved to a separate method `findAccountById`.
3. **Feature Envy**: The `withdraw` and `deposit` methods in the `Account` class now handle the balance checks and updates, reducing the responsibility of the `performTransaction` method in the `Bank` class.
4. **Mysterious Name**: The method names `deduct` and `add` have been changed to `withdraw` and `deposit` to make their purpose clearer.

This refactoring improves readability and maintainability while ensuring that the external behavior of the code remains the same. The test file remains unchanged, and all tests should still pass.
