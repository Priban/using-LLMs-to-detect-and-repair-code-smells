### Step 1: Identify the Code Smell

The code contains several code smells:
1. **Message Chains**: There are long chains of method calls, e.g., `this.getCustomerInfo().getBanking().getAccount().getBalance()`.
2. **Middle Man**: Classes like `AccountDetails`, `CustomerInfo`, `PersonalDetails`, and `Banking` are acting as intermediaries without adding significant value.
3. **Large Class**: The `Customer` and `Bank` classes are doing too much.
4. **Data Clumps**: The `CustomerInfo` and `AccountInfo` classes are just grouping data without behavior.

### Step 2: Definition of the Code Smell

1. **Message Chains**: Occurs when a client asks one object for another object, which the client then asks for yet another object, and so on. This makes the code harder to read and maintain.
2. **Middle Man**: When a class is delegating almost all of its work to another class, it becomes unnecessary and can be removed.
3. **Large Class**: A class that has too many responsibilities, making it difficult to understand and maintain.
4. **Data Clumps**: Groups of data that are often found together but are not encapsulated in a meaningful way.

### Step 3: Refactor the Code

Let's refactor the code to address these issues.

#### Refactored Code

```javascript
class Funds {
  constructor(balance) {
    this.balance = balance;
  }

  deposit(amount) {
    this.balance += amount;
  }

  withdraw(amount) {
    if (amount <= this.balance) {
      this.balance -= amount;
    } else {
      throw new Error("Insufficient funds");
    }
  }

  getBalance() {
    return this.balance;
  }
}

class Account {
  constructor(accountNumber, balance) {
    this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
    this.funds = new Funds(balance);
  }

  deposit(amount) {
    this.funds.deposit(amount);
  }

  withdraw(amount) {
    this.funds.withdraw(amount);
  }

  getBalance() {
    return this.funds.getBalance();
  }
}

class Customer {
  constructor(name, accountNumber, initialBalance) {
    this.name = name;
    this.account = new Account(accountNumber, initialBalance);
  }

  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }

  getAccountBalance() {
    return this.account.getBalance();
  }

  depositToAccount(amount) {
    this.account.deposit(amount);
  }

  withdrawFromAccount(amount) {
    this.account.withdraw(amount);
  }
}

class Bank {
  constructor() {
    this.customers = [];
  }

  addCustomer(customer) {
    this.customers.push(customer);
  }

  getCustomerByName(name) {
    return this.customers.find(customer => customer.getName() === name);
  }

  deposit(name, amount) {
    const customer = this.getCustomerByName(name);
    if (customer) {
      customer.depositToAccount(amount);
    } else {
      throw new Error("Customer not found");
    }
  }

  withdraw(name, amount) {
    const customer = this.getCustomerByName(name);
    if (customer) {
      customer.withdrawFromAccount(amount);
    } else {
      throw new Error("Customer not found");
    }
  }

  getBalance(name) {
    const customer = this.getCustomerByName(name);
    if (customer) {
      return customer.getAccountBalance();
    } else {
      throw new Error("Customer not found");
    }
  }
}

class API {
  constructor() {
    this.bank = new Bank();
  }

  addCustomer(name, accountNumber, initialBalance) {
    const customer = new Customer(name, accountNumber, initialBalance);
    this.bank.addCustomer(customer);
  }

  deposit(name, amount) {
    this.bank.deposit(name, amount);
  }

  withdraw(name, amount) {
    this.bank.withdraw(name, amount);
  }

  getBalance(name) {
    return this.bank.getBalance(name);
  }
}

module.exports = { API };
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Removed Middle Man Classes**: Removed `AccountDetails`, `CustomerInfo`, `PersonalDetails`, and `Banking` classes as they were just intermediaries.
2. **Simplified Message Chains**: Directly accessed the required methods without chaining through multiple objects.
3. **Consolidated Data**: Moved the `accountNumber` and `balance` directly into the `Account` class and `name` into the `Customer` class.
4. **Maintained API Structure**: Ensured the `API` class structure and methods remain the same to keep the external behavior consistent.

### Step 4: Verify Tests

The test file remains the same, and the refactored code should pass all the tests as the external behavior of the `API` class has not changed.
