### Step 1: Identify the Code Smell in the Code

The code contains the following code smells:
1. **Data Class**: The `Customer` class is essentially a data holder with no significant behavior.
2. **Feature Envy**: The `BankingService` class is heavily dependent on the `Customer` class's data to perform its operations.
3. **Long Function**: The `printCustomerDetails` method in `BankingService` could be simplified.
4. **Primitive Obsession**: The `Customer` class uses primitive types for balances, which could be encapsulated in a more meaningful class.

### Step 2: Definition of the Code Smell

1. **Data Class**: A class that contains only fields and simple getters and setters. Such classes do not contain any significant behavior.
2. **Feature Envy**: A method that seems more interested in a class other than the one it actually is in. This often means that the method should be moved to the class it is more interested in.
3. **Long Function**: A function that is too long and does too many things, making it hard to understand and maintain.
4. **Primitive Obsession**: The use of primitive data types to represent domain ideas, which can lead to code that is harder to understand and maintain.

### Step 3: Refactor the Code

#### Refactored Code:

```javascript
class Balance {
  constructor(savings, checking) {
    this.savings = savings;
    this.checking = checking;
  }

  getTotalBalance() {
    return this.savings + this.checking;
  }
}

class Customer {
  constructor(name, balance) {
    this.name = name;
    this.balance = balance;
  }

  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }

  getBalance() {
    return this.balance;
  }
}

class BankingService {
  constructor() {}

  printCustomerDetails(customer) {
    const name = customer.getName();
    const totalBalance = customer.getBalance().getTotalBalance();
    console.log(`Customer: ${name}, Total Balance: ${totalBalance}`);
  }
}

class API {
  constructor() {
    this.bankingService = new BankingService();
  }

  createCustomer(name, savingsBalance, checkingBalance) {
    const balance = new Balance(savingsBalance, checkingBalance);
    return new Customer(name, balance);
  }

  getTotalBalance(customer) {
    return customer.getBalance().getTotalBalance();
  }

  printDetails(customer) {
    this.bankingService.printCustomerDetails(customer);
  }
}

module.exports = { API };
```

#### Explanation of Refactoring:

1. **Encapsulated Balances**: Created a `Balance` class to encapsulate the savings and checking balances and provide a method to calculate the total balance.
2. **Moved Behavior to Customer**: Moved the `getTotalBalance` method to the `Balance` class and used it within the `Customer` class.
3. **Simplified BankingService**: Simplified the `BankingService` class by removing the `calculateTotalBalance` method and using the `getTotalBalance` method from the `Balance` class.
4. **Improved Readability**: The `printCustomerDetails` method in `BankingService` is now more straightforward and easier to understand.

The refactored code maintains the same external behavior and structure of the `API` class, ensuring that all tests will still pass.
